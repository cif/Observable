Observable
==========

Allows Backbone.Model attributes to easily become ko.observable() functions making two way binding with the DOM super easy in Backbone apps.

Why?
==========

If you want to use Knockout's super convenient bindings but also want to leverage Backbone functionality, this super simple library has your back.

How?
==========

**Observable.Model** wraps observable attributes in `Observable.Attribute` which contains a `ko.observable()` property and subscribes to it. and model attributes via Backbone.Model change event allowing you to observe and update `Backbone.Model` attributes easily. It will also automatically update the knockout bindings when your application code changes backbone models. 

Observable.Model supports complex attribute structures recursively. By default, all attributes are observed however. The `observable:` property allows you to specify which fields you want to observe which can avoid excess overhead observing large models.

Usage
=========

Javascript:

    var Contact = Observable.Model.extend({
      observe:'name,email,phone'
    }); 

    var ContactViewModel = function(){
      
       this.contact = new Contact({
         name:'Ben Ipsen',
         phone:'555-555-5555',
         email:'email@benipsen.com',
         company:{
           name:'Creative Informations',
           location:'Bend, Oregon'
         }
       });
      
       // add observations programatically
       // make sure to add any additional observeers 
       // before calling ko.applyBindings
       this.contact.makeObservation('company');
      
       // apply bindings
       ko.applyBindings(this);
       
       this.updatePhone = function(phone){
         this.model.set('phone', phone); // automatically updates!
         // NO LONGER NEEDED: $('.phone').text(phone);
       };
       
    };
   

Markup:

Apply bindings as you normally would with Knockout. Note that observable properties of models are stored as string references accessible with dot syntax instead of a deep copy (for now). Eventually, a more "legit" method of access might be nice. See `Observable.propertyFromString` for details.

     <h2 data-bind="text: contact.observable['phone']"></h2>
     <h4 data-bind="text: contact.observable['company.name']"></h4>
     <input type="text" data-bind="textInput: contact.observable['phone']">
